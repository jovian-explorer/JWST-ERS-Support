# JWST-ERS-Support

Here we provide tutorials, images, and data sets for objects that have been observed by TESS and are part of the JWST Early Release Science and commissioning data programs. 

## Where do I start with TESS Exoplanet Data?

If you need to get started with TESS data, these tutorials are for you! The first set of tutorials focus on planetary systems. Each tutorial provides information on the specific system and demonstrates how to obtain a basic TESS light curve for the planet of interest, in addition to deriving the planetary period and transit light curve. These tutorials are in a Jupyter notebook format and are listed as follows:

- WASP 96b: WASP-96.ipynb 
- WASP 39b: WASP-39.ipynb
- WASP-43b: WASP-43b.ipynb
- WASP-18b: WASP-18.ipynb

## Just give me the best light curves you've got!

If you're here to get the light curve datasets for the exoplanet targets, you're in the right place. A detailed light curve extraction process for each planetary system can be found with the notebook:

- JWST-ERS-TESS-Lightcurve-Reduction.ipynb

This notebook creates the most refined TESS light-curves, applying more advanced noise removal techniques. 

The light curves are available in the `lightcurve_data` folder as both CSV and fits files. 

The notebook creates files for all planets observed as part of JWST ERS and commisioning programs, including: HAT-P-14, HAT-P-18, and TOI-134.

## How do I get started with TESS AGN data?

Our second set of tutorials focus on Active Galactic Nuclei. In this tutorial we examine the active galaxy NGC 4151.

- NGC 4151: NGC4151.ipynb

## How do I get started with TESS Stellar data?

Our last tutorial focuses on Wolf-Rayet star WR 140. You can read more about how to work with stars such as WR 140 in this notebook:

- WR-140: WR140.ipyb

## How can I learn more about these systems?

Several of the systems examined in this repository have also been made the focus of NASA Features. The links below provide additional information about these objects in addition to beautiful images.
