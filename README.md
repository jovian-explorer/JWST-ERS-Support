# JWST-ERS-Support

Here we provide tutorials, images, and data sets for objects that have been observed by TESS and are part of the JWST Early Release Science programs. 

The first set of tutorials focus on planetary systems. Each tutorial provides information on the specific system and demonstrates how to obtain a basic TESS light curve for the planet of interest, in addition to deriving the planetary period and transit light curve. These tutorials are in a Jupyter notebook format and are listed as follows:

- WASP 96b: WASP-96.ipynb 
- WASP 39b: WASP-39.ipynb
- WASP-43b: WASP-43b.ipynb
- WASP-18b: WASP-18.ipynb

A more detailed light curve extraction process for each planetary system can be found with the notebook entitled:
JWST-ERS-TESS-Lightcurve-Reduction.ipynb

This notebook allows for the creation of the most refined TESS light-curves, applying more advanced noise removal techniques and providing the user with light curve files in both FITs format and CSV. These resultant files can be found within the lightcurve_data folder. The notebook also allows for the reduction of TESS data associated with several additional planets observed as part of JWST ERS programs, including: HAT-P-14, HAT-P-18, and TOI-134.

Our second set of tutorials focus on non-exoplanet science, looking at objects that vary in brightness over a period of time such as AGN or variable stars. In this repository we examine the active galaxy NGC 4151 and the variable Wolf Rayet system WR-140.

- WR-140: WR140.ipyb

Several of the systems examined in this repository have also been made the focus of NASA Features. The links below provide additional information about these objects in addition to beautiful images.
